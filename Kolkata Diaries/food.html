                </a>
                <img src="image/Sharbat.jpg" alt="">
                <p>A drink made of chilled water, burnt raw mangoes and sugar, it is an instant relief that you will get on a sweltering summer afternoon (and with the Kolkata heat you might as well require it). The raw mangoes are burnt, but only partially, with the skin a bit charred which lends a smoky taste to the drink. Best served chilled; this drink is surely the one which is more relaxing and refreshing than the colas with artificial sweetness.</p>
